Subject:  Join us for Special Outpost Dinner & Talk this evening at the Hey’s!

Body:
Hi [FirstName]!
Hope your week has been going well!
Lori and I hope you can carve time out of your day today to join us for a very special Outpost dinner at our home.
We're going to share a great meal together, a short time of worship, and then hear from a great speaker, Bob Mason, who is coming all the way from southern California to join us!
Bob has been training young future physicians how to fully integrate their faith with their work life in medicine, including how to take a good spiritual history.
We'll meet from 5:55p-8:00p at our home at 6704 Creek Wood Drive, Chapel Hill.

If you can't join us in person due to rotations, or other travel, we'll also have Bob's talk on Zoom starting at 7:00pm

Hope to see you in person though!  Feel free to bring a friend.
If you can email me back so we can get a good head count for dinner that would be helpful.
Hope to see you soon!
